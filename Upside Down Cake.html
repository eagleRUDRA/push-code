<h2><p><i>The classic version of this butter style cake is traditionally made with pineapple, but can be made with many varieties of fruits, including plums, peaches, blueberries, or pears. The toppings are spread on the bottom of the pan, often with butter and sugar, and then topped with cake batter. After cooking, the cake is turned out so that the fruit is facing up.</i></p></h2>
