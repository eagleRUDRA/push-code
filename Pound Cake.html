<h2><p><i>Named because it's made with a pound of each of the main ingredients (flour, butter, and sugar), this cake doesnï¿½t rise much while baking, and the texture is very dense. Our version boasts matcha and cocoa powder, but classic recipes have nothing but vanilla extract to flavor it. Bake up one of these beauties in a loaf or Bundt pan.</i></p></h2>
