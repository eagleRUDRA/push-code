<h2><p><i>Many a kid's birthday party is celebrated with a sheet-cake version of this dessert that's topped with billows of chocolate frosting and rainbow sprinkles. Yellow butter cakes often involve creaming the butter and sugar together (in modern times, this is done with an electric mixer) then adding the dry and wet ingredients, but there are also �dump� versions where all of the ingredients are thrown into a bowl and simply mixed together.</i></p></h2>
